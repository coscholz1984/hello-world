# hello-world

Hi!

My name is Christian and I'm a PostDoc at Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf.
I studied at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg and hold a PhD in Physics
from the University of Stuttgart. My research is focused on self-organization and
structure of active soft and granular matter. I am currently developing experiments
on active matter based on 3d printable particles.
